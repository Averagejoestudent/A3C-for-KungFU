### Repository Description: A3C Implementation for Atari Kung Fu

This repository contains an implementation of the **Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C)** algorithm applied to the classic Atari game **Kung Fu Master**. A3C is a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithm that uses asynchronous environments to train both a policy and a value function efficiently.

#### Key Features:
- Implementation of the A3C algorithm for training an AI agent in the Atari Kung Fu Master environment.
- Support for parallel environments to leverage asynchronous learning.
- Visualization of training progress, including rewards and policy behavior.
- Code structured for scalability and easy adaptation to other Atari games.

#### Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/PyTorch (as per implementation specifics)
- OpenAI Gym and related Atari environment dependencies

#### Usage:
1. Install the dependencies.
2. Run the notebook to train the A3C agent on Kung Fu Master.
3. Evaluate and visualize the agent's performance.
